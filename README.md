Hello! FÃ¦z here. 26y/o Landscape Architect residing in Beirut, Lebanon. 

Slowly - sometimes too slow to my liking - but surely trying to learn web dev and compsci through online MOOCs. 
It's challenging seeing that I come from a design background, but I'm intent on learning - even when that means having my cognitive butt kicked again and again.
My interest lies in web based apps as well as what is currently called 'creative coding'.
* Try out my first attempt at a game I created as part of Harvard's CS50x MOOC. I did it from/with Scratch [https://scratch.mit.edu/users/saltbrain/].
